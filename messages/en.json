Who We Are\n\nWelcome to Lumina AI — we create smart automation solutions to help small and medium-sized businesses save time and focus on what matters most.\n\nWe are based in the United Kingdom and act as the data controller for the personal information you share with us.\n\nAddress: Unit 156962, PO Box 7169, Poole, BH15 9EL\nEmail: luminaai300@gmail.com\n\n2. The Information We Collect\n\nWe only collect what's necessary to provide our services and keep in touch with you. This may include:\n\n• Your name and surname\n• Email address\n• Business name and industry\n• Any details you share when you contact us or fill in a form\n\nWe never ask for sensitive data unless it's essential for a specific project — and if we do, we'll always explain why and ask for your consent first.\n\n3. How We Use Your Information\n\nWe use your data to:\n\n• Communicate with you about your enquiry or project\n• Provide and improve our automation services\n• Send updates, resources, or offers (only if you've given consent)\n• Analyse how our website performs (through cookies and analytics tools)\n\nWe do not sell or rent your personal information — ever.\n\n4. Legal Basis for Processing\n\nDepending on the situation, we process your data based on:\n\n• Your consent (for marketing emails and newsletters)\n• Legitimate interest (for communication, analytics, and business operations)\n• Contractual necessity (to deliver services you've requested)\n\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at luminaai300@gmail.com.\n\n5. Cookies and Tracking\n\nOur website uses cookies and similar tools (like Meta Pixel) to understand how people interact with our content and improve your experience.\n\nYou'll always see a cookie banner or notice that allows you to accept or adjust your preferences. You can also disable cookies in your browser settings at any time.\n\n6. The Tools and Platforms We Use\n\nTo deliver automation and AI solutions, we work with secure and GDPR-compliant tools such as:\n\n• n8n (workflow automation platform)\n• OpenAI integrations (for natural language automation)\n• Vercel (our website hosting provider, with servers located in the EU and US)\n\nThese platforms process data on our behalf under strict data protection agreements.

Data Retention\n\nWe keep your information only for as long as needed:\n\n• For clients — until your project or contract ends\n• For subscribers — until you unsubscribe or withdraw consent\n• For analytics — for a limited period to understand usage trends\n\nAfter that, your data is securely deleted or anonymised.\n\n9. Your Rights\n\nUnder the UK GDPR, you have the right to:\n\n• Access the personal data we hold about you\n• Request corrections or deletion\n• Withdraw consent for marketing\n• Object to certain processing activities\n• Ask us to transfer your data (data portability)\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, simply email us at luminaai300@gmail.com.\n\n10. Security\n\nWe use encryption, access controls, and secure storage to protect your data. Only authorised team members or contractors (like our developer) can access personal information, and only when it's necessary for project delivery.\n\n11. Changes to This Policy\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in how we work or new legal requirements. The latest version will always be available on our website.\n\n12.
